# Cortex-R Agent

An intelligent agent framework capable of reasoning, memory, and multi-step task execution through a modular tool-based architecture.

## Overview

Cortex-R is an advanced AI agent system that processes user queries through a perception-planning-action loop. The agent is designed to:

1. Remember past conversations and provide answers from history when available
2. Use a variety of tools to solve complex problems step-by-step
3. Apply intelligent heuristics to sanitize inputs and improve outputs
4. Execute Python code dynamically to solve user queries

## Core Components

1. **Agent Loop** (`core/loop.py`): Orchestrates the overall process flow
2. **Perception Module** (`modules/perception.py`): Analyzes user input to determine intent and select appropriate tools
3. **Decision Module** (`modules/decision.py`): Generates a plan as executable Python code
4. **Action Module** (`modules/action.py`): Executes the plan in a controlled sandbox environment
5. **Memory System** (`modules/memory.py`): Stores conversation history and session context
6. **Input/Output Heuristics** (`core/heuristics.py`): Sanitizes inputs and improves outputs

The investigation revealed that funds intended for electric vehicle procurement were diverted to purchase a ₹43 crore luxury apartment in DLF\'s "The Camellias" project in Gurugram.\ue206 **Key Findings:** - **Diversion of Funds:** SEBI traced ₹42.94 crore from Capbridge Ventures LLP, where both Anmol and Puneet Singh Jaggi are designated partners, to a payment made to DLF. The apartment was initially booked in the name of the promoters\' mother, Jasminder Kaur, with a ₹5 crore advance, which was later refunded and replaced by Capbridge as the final buyer.\ue206 - **Layered Transactions:** The funds originated from Gensol, passed through its vendor Go-Auto and related entities, before reaching DLF. The ₹5 crore booking advance was sourced from Gensol’s funds via multiple related parties and, once refunded by DLF, rerouted to another related entity—Matrix Gas and Renewables. SEBI stated that these transactions demonstrate layered fund flows to disguise personal asset acquisition using public company funds.\ue206 - **Broader Financial Misconduct:** Gensol borrowed over ₹977 crore from institutions like IREDA and PFC for procuring 6,400 electric vehicles but acquired only 4,704, costing ₹567.73 crore. Nearly ₹262 crore remains unaccounted for, allegedly misappropriated through Go-Auto and channeled to multiple promoter-related entities.\ue206 - **Corporate Governance Failures:** SEBI noted a complete breakdown of corporate governance at Gensol, with promoters using the company’s resources for personal expenses, including purchasing luxury real estate and engaging in speculative trading in Gensol’s own shares via Wellray Solar.\ue206 **Regulatory Actions:** - SEBI has barred Anmol and Puneet Singh Jaggi from acting as directors or key managerial personnel in Gensol and prohibited them, along with Gensol, from trading in the securities market.\ue206 - A planned 1:10 stock split has been frozen to protect investors.\ue206 - A forensic audit has been ordered to examine financial records of Gensol and its related entities.\ue206 - SEBI also cited misleading disclosures by Gensol, including exaggerated claims of EV orders and strategic tie-ups, none of which were backed by binding contracts or financial rationale.\ue206 SEBI has warned retail investors to exercise caution, especially in light of the potential for promoters to offload remaining stakes and erode value further.\ue206 --- For the full article and more detailed information, you can visit the original source: \ue200link\ue202turn0search0\ue201.\n[Source: economic.md, ID: economic_0]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='Businesses should respect and make efforts to protect and restore the environment **Essential Indicators** **1.** **Details of total energy consumption (in Joules or multiples) and energy intensity, in the following format** **[11]** **:** |Parameter|FY 2022-23|FY 2021-22| |---|---|---| |Total electricity consumption (A) [in Gigajoules (GJ)]|19,62,084.39|13,99,607.99| |Total fuel consumption (B) (in GJ)|3,10,853.10|12,51,050.45| |Energy consumption through other sources (C) (in GJ)|-|-| |Total energy consumption (A+B+C) (in GJ)|22,72,937.49|26,50,658.44| |Energy intensity per rupee of turnover12 (Total energy consumption in GJ/ turnover in rupees)|0.000040|0.000046| |Energy intensity per area of total portfolio [Total energy consumption in GJ/ area of portfolio (including total leasable and saleable area) in sq. mtr.]|0.301|0.397| **Note: Indicate, if any independent assessment/ evaluation/ assurance has been carried out by an external** **agency?

It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company's $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India's biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of ₹31.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of ₹15.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF's first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company's growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A ₹58 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to ₹2 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi. Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon. This stretch from NH8 Toll Plaza to Sector 55/56 in Gurgaon with six underpasses, one flyover and freeways has improved traffic management in the city.[16] To create this\n[Source: dlf.md, ID: dlf_0]", annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='of information, like any other business asset, is one of the key priorities in the business processes, to prevent any theft, tampering, misuse and unauthorized access.
